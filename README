USAGE
=====

Exposes Jakarta POI library for XLS manipulation through a built-in object 
called workbook in the view template. View names should use a .rxls as the extension

# Simple Example

# views/controller_name/report.rxls

sheet = workbook.createSheet("new sheet")
row = sheet.createRow(0)
row.createCell(0).setCellValue(1)
row.createCell(1).setCellValue(1.2)
row.createCell(2).setCellValue("This is a Testing Row")
row.createCell(3).setCellValue("Guru Krupa")


# controller returns '110.xls'
def report
	@client = Client.find(params[:id]) # Which is 110
	render :action => 'report', :layout => false
end

# controller returns 'report.xls'
def report
   render :action => "report", :layout => false
end

# controller returns 'my-report.xls'
def report
   @worksheet_name = 'my-report.xls'
   render :action => "report", :layout => false
end

# For large Worksheet documents 

# Use CellBatch to batch the cell inserts/updates
# Use RowGroupBatch to batch the row grouping calls
# When only single sheet is present, the cell as well as row group
# changes are applied at once aumatically as a single Batch call using
# a custom java Helper function
# When multiple sheets are present, after doing the sheet specific
# cell as well as group operations call CellBatch.write_to(sheet_object)
# for cell updates.
# Call RowGroupBatch.group_rows to apply rowGroupings.

CellBatch.add(5,1,"Row 6 col 1")
CellBatch.add(5,2,"Row 6 col 2")
 
CellBatch.add(7,1,"Row 8 col 1")
CellBatch.add(8,2,"Row 9 col 2")

RowGroupBatch.add(7,8)

CellBatch.add(9,1,"Two rows above is grouped")
